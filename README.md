# Predictive_Maintenance

I worked on this project in September 2022 during the compulsory 1-month internship process. 

In this document, a study has been conducted using machine learning on the Turbofan jet engine dataset, which is openly shared by NASA Glenn Research Center. The libraries, datasets and codes used in the study are included in this document. The purpose of the document is to give information about whether machine learning can be used on a different turbofan engine and how it should be used if it is.

Engines start normally but develop a malfunction over time. In normal times, jet engines are serviced before each take-off, and this is an inexpensive form of periodic maintenance. For this reason, it is desired to determine the time of failure with training sets in advance. The dataset contains information from different sensors. Columns in the data set;
1. Engine Unit Number
2. Time (in Cycles)
3. Three Operational Settings
4. 21 Data from the sensor
